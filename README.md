## Overview
### Description
The application allows users to plan their meals for the next week, and check the meals they have planned for the day.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health & Fitness/Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** The app is suited for mobile use since it gives users easy access to see their meal plans daily and be notified daily.
- **Story:** Everyone starts the year with a fitness goal, part of this goal is starting and continuing a healthier diet – with this tracker it helps keeps yourself accountable and be able to see the progress you are making.
- **Market:** The app would be targeted towards those who desire to track their food intake.
- **Habit:** The users would open this app every day to check the meals they have planned for the day. Every start of the week, they would spend more time setting up the meal plan.
- **Scope:** The application would have the core feature of being able to set a plan for the week, and letting the users browse through a selection of recipes. Since we are not building out the API from scratch, this would be doable in the duration of this program.
